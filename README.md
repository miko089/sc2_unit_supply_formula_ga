# sc2_unit_supply_formula_ga

## Dataset
Collection of starcraft zerg's unit supply cost and ids of these units

## Chromosome Representation
some string on alphabet "0123456789+-*/()|&^%x"

## Fitness Function
The fitness function evaluates how closely the formula represented by a chromosome matches the actual supply costs of Zerg units in StarCraft II. The fitness score is calculated based on the difference between the predicted supply costs generated by the formula and the actual supply costs for each unit in the dataset. A lower difference results in a higher fitness score, indicating a better match between the formula and the actual data.

## Desired result
Get such formula that would be able to calculate supply cost of zerg units in starcraft 2 based on their unit ids and require less memory than hardcoded dictionary.
